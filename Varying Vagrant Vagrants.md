Requirements
VVV requires recent versions of both Vagrant and VirtualBox to be installed.

Vagrant is a “tool for building and distributing development environments”. It works with virtualization software such as VirtualBox to provide a virtual machine sandboxed from your local environment.

In addition to VirtualBox, provider support is also included for Parallels, Hyper-V, VMWare Fusion, and VMWare Workstation.
